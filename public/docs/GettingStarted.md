### Introduction

We want you to think that Vn4CMS is like a framework with built-in functions, making it easy for you to start developing a project without building repetitive functions.

---
## React js (UI) + Laravel (API) = Vn4CMS

## Enviroment

#### PHP

Although an installer is available from <a href="https://www.php.net/downloads.php" target="_blank">php.net</a>, I would recommend the manual installation if you already have a web server configured and running.

##### Package manager

We use <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a> to install and manage third-party libraries.

---

#### Node JS

To install and use Vn4CMS UI, you will need <a  href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> installed on your machine. We highly encourage to have the latest node version to as we are developing & updateing only for the latest releases of Node Js.

##### Package manager

We use <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/" target="_blank">Yarn</a> to install and manage third-party libraries. You can use any alternatives ( <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"  target="_blank">npm</a> ).

## Frameword, Libraries

### Laravel

### React
