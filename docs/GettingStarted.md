### Introduction

We want you to think that Vn4CMS is like a framework with built-in functions, making it easy for you to start developing a project without building repetitive functions.

---
## React js (UI) + Laravel (API) = Vn4CMS

## Enviroment

#### PHP

Although an installer is available from [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads.php), I would recommend the manual installation if you already have a web server configured and running.

##### Package manager

We use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install and manage third-party libraries.

---

#### Node JS

To install and use Vn4CMS UI, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. We highly encourage to have the latest node version to as we are developing & updateing only for the latest releases of Node Js.

##### Package manager

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to install and manage third-party libraries. You can use any alternatives ( [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) ).

## Frameword, Libraries

### Laravel

### React

##### Material-UI

[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) is a React ui components library that implements Google's Material Design design specifications.

##### Create React App (CLI)

[Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.


### Installation

##### A. Installing Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of Node.js from their official website.

1. Unzip the zip file that you have downloaded from Material-Ui. Inside the zip file, you will find the the source file (exactly this demo project) (react-material-kit-pro-x.x.x-.zip) and design folder where you will find two more folders for figma and sketch source files.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file (react-material-kit-pro-x.x.x-.zip) into a folder that you will work within. For this documentation, we will refer that as "your work folder".
3. Open your machine console application (Terminal, Command Prompt etc.), navigate into your work folder and run the following command and wait for it to finish:
